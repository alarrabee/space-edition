# DEV Frontend Challenge - Space Edition

*Frontend Challenge v24.09.04: [Space Edition](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-09-04)*

**What is a DEV Challeng?** DEV Challenges are like mini hackathons that are divided into different domains, such as "The Frontend Challenge" or "The AI Challenge," allowing participants to gain experience with new tools or showcase their skills publicly. Each challenge lasts about two weeks and may restart based on community interest, sometimes with new prompts. Challenges are designed to be small, approachable, and showcase creativity.

## Challenge Prompts

**CSS Art: Space**

Draw what comes to mind for you when it comes to Space. Is it your favorite movie? The current news cycle? Or does your imagination drum up something totally out-of-this-world? Whatever it is, please share it with us via CSS art!

**Glam Up My Markup: Solar System**

Use CSS and JavaScript to make the below starter HTML markup for the Solar System visually stunning, interactive, and educational. We've provided a basic template that lists planets, moons, and other celestial objects in our Solar System, along with some facts about each. Since the template doesn't include any design elements or interactivity, youâ€™ll need to get creative to make it visually appealing and engaging. Your submission should enhance the user experience with a fun, dynamic design, but must also be accessible and easy to use. You should avoid directly modifying the HTML itself, unless it is through JavaScript. Your final submission should balance style and substance. You may add basic boilerplate code, such as meta tags and structure, to ensure proper presentation and functionality.
